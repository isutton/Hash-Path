Hash-Path

This module was written as proof of concept about how to find data inside a hash of hashes (HoH) with
unknown structure. You can think that as hierarchical data like LDAP does, so our C<path> could be the
exactly the same as LDAP's C<dn>, but a bit simpler because we (at least at this moment, who knows) don't
want to deal with that.

This is a perfect companion for traversing L<YAML>:

	use Hash::Path;
	use YAML;

	my ($hash_ref) = Load(<<'EOF');
	---
	name: john
	permissions:
	  some-module:
	    - read
	    - write
	    - execute
	  another-module:
	    - read
	EOF
	my $permissions = Hash::Path->get($hash_ref, qw(permissions some-module));

	# $permissions contains [ 'read', 'write', 'execute' ]
